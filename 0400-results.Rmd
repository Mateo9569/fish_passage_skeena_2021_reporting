## Phase 1

Field assessments were conducted between `r format(min(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` and `r format(max(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Kyle Prince, P.Biol., Tieasha Pierre, Vern Joseph, Dallas Nikal, Alexandria Nikal, Chad Lewis, Tim Wilson, Adam Wrench, Lars Reese-Hanson and Don Morgan. A total of `r n_distinct(pscis_phase1$my_crossing_reference)` Phase 1 assessments were conducted with `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Passable') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "passable", `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings considered "potential" barriers and `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Barrier') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "barriers" according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length [@fish_passage_assessments]. Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Unknown') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings assessed were fords and ranked as "unknown" according to the provincial protocol. Georeferenced field maps are presented  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/) and available for bulk download as [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")} else knitr::asis_output("in [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")` A summary of crossings assessed, a cost benefit analysis and priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites presented in Table \@ref(tab:cost-est-phase-1).

<br>

"Barrier" and "Potential Barrier" rankings used in this project followed @fish_passage_assessments and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005 ;@bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013].  As noted in @bourne_etal2011Barriersfish, with a detailed review of different criteria in @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates [@bourne_etal2011Barriersfish; @shaw_etal2016Importancepartial; @mahlum_etal2014EvaluatingBarrier; @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating].  @washingtondepartmentoffishwildlife2009FishPassage present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments.  These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

## Bulkley Falls Assessment
Bulkley Falls is located near Topley, BC on the mainstem of the Bulkley River. Information on the crossing was scarce so an assessment was prioritized by Canadian Wildlife Federation. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician.  The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-bfalls-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-bfalls-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-bfalls-d02))."))`. Water temperature was 3.0$^\circ$C, pH was 7.75 and conductivity was 159uS/cm. Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm.  The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm.

<br>

@dyson1949BulkleyFalls and @stokes1956UpperBulkley report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports.  Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend.  @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows.  @stokes1956UpperBulkley reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Bulkley River from the outlet of Bulkley Lake.

## Phase 2


During 2021 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at `r hab_site_priorities %>% nrow()` sites in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups.  A total of approximately `r habitat_confirmations_priorities %>% pull(length_surveyed) %>% sum(na.rm = T) %>% round(-3)/1000`km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing was conducted at five sites, and five sites were mapped using remotely piloted aircraft. Georeferenced field maps are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/) and available for bulk download as [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")`

<br>

As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary.  In total, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'high') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english() %>% str_to_title()` crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Moderate') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Low') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and ")}`Tables \@ref(tab:tab-overview) - \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all) with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as [Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/raw/master/data/habitat_confirmations.xls).  A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating the quantity of chinook, coho and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-model-all). Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.

### Fish Sampling

Fish sampling was conducted at `r tab_fish_sites_sum %>% n_distinct()` sites with a total of `r hab_fish_indiv %>% filter(species_code != 'NFC') %>% nrow()` fish captured.  Of these, `r hab_fish_indiv %>% filter(species_code == 'RB') %>% nrow()` were rainbow trout,  `r hab_fish_indiv %>% filter(species_code == 'CO') %>% nrow()` coho, `r hab_fish_indiv %>% filter(species_code == 'DV') %>% nrow()` were dolly varden and `r hab_fish_indiv %>% filter(species_code == 'L') %>% nrow()` were lamprey.  Fork length data was used to delineate salmonids based on life stages: fry (0 to 65mm), parr (>65 to 110mm), juvenile (>110mm to 140mm) and adult (>140mm) by visually assessing the histograms presented in Figure \@ref(fig:fish-histogram).  A summary of sites assessed are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-summary) and raw data is provided in [Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/raw/master/data/habitat_confirmations.xls). A summary of density results for all life stages combined of select species is also presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all). Results are presented in greater detail within individual habitat confirmation site appendices.

## Phase 3

Engineering designs have been completed for replacement of PSCIS crossing 58159 on McDowell Creek [@irvine2021BulkleyRiver] with a clear-span bridge and for removal of the collapsed bridge (PSCIS crossing 197912) on Robert Hatch Creek.  At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was in the process of procuring designs for remediation of fish passage at three sites documented in @irvine2021BulkleyRiver including PSCIS 123445 on Tyhee Creek, PSCIS 124500 on Helps Creek and PSCIS 197640 on a tributary to Buck Creek.  Additionally, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure were procuring a design for PSCIS crossing 124420 on Mission Creek (a.k.a Station Creek) in Hazleton (pers. comm. Sean Wong, Environmental Programs, MoTi). Details for the habitat confirmation of Mission Creek are included in the associated appendix of this report.

## Phase 4

Ministry of Forest engineers collaborated with Canfor and Coastal Gaslink to replace crossing 197962 on Peacock Creek located on the Morice FSR within the Morice River watershed group.  As detailed in the associated attachment within this report, baseline effectiveness monitoring including multipass electrofishing at three closed sites both upstream and downstream of the FSR in the fall of 2021 before the bridge install occurred.
