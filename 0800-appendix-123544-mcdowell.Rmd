## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 3.5km south-east of Telkwa, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` and `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)`.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was located a further `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site2, col_pull = downstream_route_measure) - fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)`m upstream.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on private land so likely the responsibility of the landowner. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.


<br>

## Background {-}


`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` drains McDowell Lake (35ha), Dorsay Lake (4ha) and one other unnamed lake (9ha) flowing from McDowell Lake in a south then west direction for approximately 9km to the confluence with the Bulkley River adjacent to the Woodmere Nursery. At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-123544)). 

<br>

Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. An adjacent landowner reports that historic high flow events in the watershed were likely related to beaver dam failures in the upper reaches of the stream network.

<br>

A habitat confirmation assessment downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` PSCIS stream crossing 58159 (Woodmere Nursery private road) was assessed with  by @irvine2021BulkleyRiver in 2020 and the reader is directed there for detailed background, habitat assessment and fish sampling information from 2020 surveys. `r as.character(my_site2)` was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up by @irvine2018AnalysisPriority due to significant quantities of upstream habitat suitable for salmonid rearing. A total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland is modelled upstream with a summary of additional habitat modelling outputs presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-123544).  A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

McDowell Creek was dewatered at both culverts at the time of the surveys.  Additionally, the stream was dry at Highway 16 and the Woodmere Nursery private road. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was not backwatered, un-embedded and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-123544)). The culvert was perched above the stream at the inlet approximately 2m and road fill had caused a steep slope (>25%) just below the culvert for 5 - 10m.

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was not backwatered, not embedded and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58151)).

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)`{-}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`
Although dry, the channel was well defined with frequent gravels throughout. The undercut banks were deeply cut an riparian vegetation was comprised of thick red-osier dogwood understory and open mature cottonwood forest. Habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 


<br>

At the time of the survey, PSCIS culvert 58158 on Highway 16 located approximately had been recently replaced with a baffled structure embedded with a natural cobble and gravel substrates.  Although ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage using the provincial metric the crossing is likely not a barrier during most flows for adult anadromous salmon and fluvial salmonids migrating upstream from the Bulkley River.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {-}


The stream was surveyed upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` for 25m and downstream from crossing 58151 for 120m 
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph()` 
Fish were observed throughout the area surveyed and extensive algae growth was present on stream substrates.  Large woody debris was rare and riparian/bank damage due to livestock was minimal and located at what appeared to be watering sites.  Fencing was located across the stream in multiple locations.  Patches of gravels suitable for spawning were present.
Habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-123544-d03))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2)`
Immediately upstream of the crossing for ~80m, extensive anthropogenic damage was noted due to dredging of the channel. Heavy cattle grazing was also observed on the left bank. Juvenile salmonids were observed occasionally throughout the area surveyed.  Fencing was located across the stream approximately 250m upstream of the culvert.  Patches of gravels suitable for spawning were present.
Habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential.


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.

Relocation of the driveway accessing the private land from the other side of the stream and removal of the crossing could also be considered. 


## Conclusion {-}

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` with areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design due to low flows and highly impacted habitats upstream. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. In the upper reaches of McDowell Creek, impacts are apparent due to adjacent land use (cattle trampled banks and grazed/removed riparian vegetation). It is recommended that a plan be developed to work with adjacent landowners and tenure holders to exclude cattle from the riparian area, implement stream restoration actions and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed.
