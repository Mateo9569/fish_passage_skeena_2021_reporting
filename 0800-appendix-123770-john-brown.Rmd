## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 650m south of the Moricetown canyon at Moricetown, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.


<br>

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to 375m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-123770)). Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, coho salmon, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish report that although spawner abundance and location are unknown, chinook have been observed with John Brown Creek at 0.4km.

@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage and @mccarthy_fernando20152015Inventory report that the culvert on John Brown at Highway 16 has received efforts to facilitate backwatering including rock lines to establish backwater pools downstream of the culvert.  

<br>


PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high priority for follow up by @irvine2018AnalysisPriority,  @irvine2021BulkleyRiver and @mazany-wright_etal2021BulkleyRiver because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing.  A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-123770). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-123770)). The crossing consisted on two pipes with baffles installed within the lower elevation pipe.  There was a significant outlet drop and the baffled pipe was not embedded for its entire length.  Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm. The stream was also assessed at the location of a modelled crossing `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site2,col_pull = downstream_route_measure)`m upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River (PSCIS `r as.character(my_site2)`) where a ford was located.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

`r fpr_my_cover_sentence(loc = 'ds')` The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant. Although rated as an important migration corridor, the habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning with high flows and limited complexity. Several dead pink salmon were noted on the fan at the confluence with the Bulkley River.

`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-123770-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-123770-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-123770-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_cover_sentence(loc = 'us')` The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant. The first 50 - 100m upstream of crossing channel and banks were noted as armoured with riprap. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids were noted throughout. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential.

<br>

The stream was also surveyed immediately upstream of PSCIS ford `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-123770-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-123770-06))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-123770-d03))"))`. `r fpr::fpr_my_cover_sentence(loc = 'us2')`. The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant.  The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us2')` value for salmon rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Fish Sampling {-}

Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-123770) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-123770) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-123770).

<br>


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.  


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. John Brown Creek is a large system with habitat suitable for numerous species includeing coho, steelhead and chinook salmon. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge may be considered as a prudent step to eliminating an outlet drop, reducing flow velocities at the highway crossing and mitigating risks of a blow out to the baffle induced partial embedding currently in place in the south pipe of the crossing.
