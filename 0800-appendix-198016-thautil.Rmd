## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. There are no other crossings on this tributary. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located approximately 700m upstream from the confluence with Thautil River and is the responsibility of West Fraser Timber Company.  

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198016)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information for areas upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`.

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-198016, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

Downstream of Morice Lake, the largest tributary (535km^2^) is formed by Thautil River and Gosnell Creek. Thautil River maintains relatively high flows throughout the year until the freeze up occurs, typically in November [@tamblyn_croft2003PlanConserve]. In a stream inventory study of the Thautil watershed conducted by @davidbustardandassociatesltd_1997StreamInventory in 1996, it was concluded that steelhead, bull trout, and dolly varden were the three predominant species found in the Thautil River. Steelhead and bull trout were utilizing larger channels with an average gradient less than 6%. Dolly varden were the predominant species in smaller tributaries, and were found in streams with a gradient of up to 13%.

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a moderate
priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198016). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198016)). There
was low flow through the culvert at the time of survey. The boulders found at the outlet could present a barrier to upstream fish migration, depending on life stage and stream flow conditions. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output("\\pagebreak")}`

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198016-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198016-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198016-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Fish were sighted downstream. There was abundant and functional large woody debris, creating cover and  deep pools. The gradient increased near the confluence, with large woody debris jams up to 1m in height forming pools approximately 0.45m deep. There were lots of undercut banks and overhanging vegetation. The stream was partially coupled at the start of survey, but transitioned to fully coupled closer to the confluence. There appeared to be abundant rearing fish habitat with suitable overwintering areas. There were patches of gravel found throughout the length surveyed, but the gradient was always greater than 5%, which is not ideal for spawning. Overall, the
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198016-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198016-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198016-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There were sporadic pools and abundant, deep undercut banks. Abundant gravels were present suitable for spawning. Few large and small woody debris steps up to 70cm in height were present. The riparian vegetation consisted primarily of mature spruce trees. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was approximately 2km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream of the culvert is recommended in order to gain insight into the fish population size and density.
