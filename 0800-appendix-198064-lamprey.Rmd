## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. This site was located on a spur road, approximately 150m upstream from the confluence with the Lamprey Creek. This crossing is the responsibility of Canfor Corporation. 

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198064)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs].

```{r tab-wshd-198064, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

Compared to other streams within the Morice watershed, Lamprey Creek is a lower elevation stream that experiences relatively low summer flows. Low flows restrict the availability of areas suitable for steelhead rearing. Significant sediment depositions into the Lamprey watershed have been caused by poor logging and road building practises. Other species that have been previously recorded in Lamprey Creek include lake chub, longnose sucker, longnose dace, and prickly sculpin [@tamblyn_croft2003PlanConserve]. In 2002, large numbers of pacific lamprey were spotted spawning in Lamprey Creek during the months of June and July [@bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice].

Although there are six modelled crossings located upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` none are on portions of stream modelled as accessible (<20%). PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC due to field notes passed on from Lars Reese Hanson (WLRS - Ecosystems Biologist). A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198064). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198064)). Fish up to 150mm long were spotted near the crossing. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.  The stream had comparatively good flow for smaller tributaries the greater Lamprey Creek watershed and review of Phase 1 assessment information indicated that the majority of Lamprey Creek tributaries assessed for fish passage during the same time period this site was assessed were dry.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Abundant undercut banks were present, but few deep pools. Water flowed beneath the substrate approximately 5m from the confluence with Lamprey creek. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There were abundant patches of gravel that would be suitable for coho spawning at higher flows. Abundant undercut banks were present that provided cover for fish, but there were very few deep pools. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value, containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. `r as.character(my_site)` was tentatively ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Although a smaller system, assessment data indicates that this stream had comparatively good flow for a smaller tributary in the greater Lamprey Creek watershed. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert could be considered in order to determine all species present and associated densities. PIT tagging of fish captured upstream and downstream could also be considered for building an understanding of how the culvert may impact local fish populations as well as provide baseline monitoring data should replacement of the crossing occur.
