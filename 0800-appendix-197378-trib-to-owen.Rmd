## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. The site was located approximately 1km upstream from the confluence with Owen Creek, which drains the nearby Owen Lake. This crossing is the responsibility of West Fraser Mills Ltd.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197378)). A total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland is modelled upstream. Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. The nearby Owen Lake is approximately 300ha in size. Historical records of fish in this lake include rainbow trout, burbot, coho, sucker, dolly varden, lake trout, and whitefish. Tributaries such as the one flowing through crossing `r as.character(my_site)` could provide critical spawning and rearing habitat for resident fish species coming from Owen Lake.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197378)). Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

##this is useful to get some comments for the report

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was a high percentage of crown closure, with riparian shrubs but a thin, coniferous forest further upland. There was low gradient throughout, abundant overhanging vegetation cover throughout the survey and deep undercut banks. There was an abundance of gravels suitable for fish spawning. The stream appears to have stable flows with no erosion. Overall, the
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning. 

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` This was a small stream containing multiple beaver influenced wetland areas with dams. This section was surveyed upstream on two branches to the location of wetland areas.  Fish presence is known upstream. Several pockets of gravel were present suitable for resident rainbow spawning. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish densities. PIT tagging of fish captured could be considered to provide valuable information on how the culvert impacts fish populations from Owen Lake and its associated watershed.
