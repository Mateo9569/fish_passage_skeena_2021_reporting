"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction This report builds on reporting from the spring of 2021 which can be referenced here. The work presented is currently in draft form for partner and stakeholder engagement purposes, contains errors and will change over time. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Wetsuweten 2.2 Gitxsan 2.3 Project Location 2.4 Fisheries 2.5 Fish Passage Restoration Planning and Implementation 2.6 Morice river", " 2 Background The study area includes the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups (Figure 2.1) and is within the traditional territories of the Gitxsan and Wetsuweten. 2.1 Wetsuweten Wetsuweten hereditary territory covers an area of 22,000km2 including the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds and portions of the Nechako River watershed. The Wetsuweten people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nuaten (Wetsuweten law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and its management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wetsuweten (Office of the Wetsuweten 2013; Office of the Wetsuweten 2021; FLNRORD 2017). 2.2 Gitxsan The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (Gitxsan Huwilp Government 2021). # Salmon is considered the source of life and always treated with high regard. It was brought by the Raven who also taught people how to fish and hunt. 2.3 Project Location knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/BulkelyMoriceOverview2.jpeg&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Areas 2.3.1 Bulkley River The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762 km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.1 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 19.5 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures 2.2 and 2.4). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (IPCC 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization (ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004 - daily discharge data from 1930 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River near Houston (Station #08EE003 - daily discharge data from 1980 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) 2.3.2 Morice River The Morice River watershed drains 4,379 km2 of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only (Environment and limate Change Canada 2021). An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near its confluence with the Bulkley River is 113.3 m3/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at 75.3 m3/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures 2.5 - 2.6). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED003.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Left: Hydrograph for Morice River near Houston (Station #08ED003 - 1971 data only).

Available daily discharge data from 1961 to 2018. 2.4 Fisheries In 2004, IBM Business Consulting Services (2006) estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars. The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery (Tamblyn 2005). 2.4.1 Bulkley River Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wetsuweten people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) detail numerous fishing areas located within the lower Bulkley drainage (from the confluence of the Skeena to the confluence with the Telkwa River) and the upper Bulkley drainage which includes the mainstem Bulkley River and tributaries upstream of the Telkwa River confluence. Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wetsuweten (Wilson and Rabnett 2007; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wetsuweten). Approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Bulkley River, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972 (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Bukley River is considered Class II waterand there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.4.2 Morice River Detailed reviews of Morice River watershed fisheries can be found in Bustard and Schell (2002), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002), Schell (2003), A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007), and ILMB (2007) with a comprehensive review of water quality by Oliver (2018). Overall, the Morice watershed contains high fisheries values as a major producer of chinook, pink, sockeye, coho and steelhead. 2.4.2.1 Fish Species Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena and Bulkley River fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wetsuweten (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure 2.7. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned. In the 1990s the Morice River watershed, A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007). Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most (Bustard and Schell 2002). Bustard and Schell (2002) report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. ##### Chinook # In the 1990&#39;s Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have recorded juvenile chinook rearing in small non natal streams. # @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have uvenile chinook have been recorded rearing in small non natal streams #It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment  Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation  Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design  Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation  Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 2.5.1 Bulkley River There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system. A non-exhaustive list of historic fish passage reports for the watershed includes Wilson and Rabnett (2007), McCarthy and Fernando (2015),Smith (2018) Casselman and Stanley (2010) and Irvine (2018). Review of the PSCIS database indicated that prior to 2020, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) at crossing structures within the Bulkley River watershed group have been recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021a). No habitat confirmations are recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021b). Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek (MoE 2021c). McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and a design is currently being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek (pers. comm.

Scripts within bcfishpass also pull and analyze data using other open-source tools such as bcdata (Norris 2021b), bcfishobs (Norris 2021c), and fwapg (Norris 2021a) which serve numerous functions related to open-data access as well as the analysis of the BC Freshwater Atlas, roads, fish and fish habitat in British Columbia. 3.1.1 Habitat Modelling bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate potentially accessible habitat were based on estimated max gradients that salmon (15% - coho and chinook) and steelhead (20%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Through this initiative and other SERN/New Graph led initiatives, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and connectivity restoration planning (Mazany-Wright et al. 2021), bcfishpass has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation. The software is under continual development and has been designed and constructed by Norris (2021d) using of sql and python based shell script libraries to generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. The model identifes natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris 2021d). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. A discussion of the methodology to derive channel width is below. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of potentially accessible habitat, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 15% and 20% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, Where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2020e) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021a) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, FISS channel width was used. When multiple FISS sites were associated with a particular stream segment a mean of the average channel widths was taken. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were sampled for each stream segments and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. Mean annual precipitation was then combined with the channel widths and BEC zone information (gathered through a spatial query tied to the bottom of the stream segment) into a dataset (n = 22990) for analysis fo the relationship between these variables. The details of this analysis and resulting formula used to estimate channel width on stream segments in the Bukley River and Morice River watersheds is included as a technical appendix here. bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2020e). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds groups have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table 3.2. Output parameters for modelling are presented in Table 3.3. #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` bcfishpass_spawn_rear_model %&gt;% mutate(Species = fishbc::fbc_common_name(species_code), spawn_gradient_max = round(spawn_gradient_max * 100 ,1), rear_gradient_max = round(rear_gradient_max * 100 ,1)) %&gt;% select(Species, `Spawning Gradient Max (%)`= spawn_gradient_max, `Spawning Width Min (m)` = spawn_channel_width_min, # `Spawning Width Max (m)` = spawn_channel_width_max, # `Spawning MAD Min (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_min, # `Spawning MAD Max (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_max, `Rearing Gradient Max (%)` = rear_gradient_max) %&gt;% # `Rearing MAD Min (m3/s)` = rear_mad_min, # `Rearing MAD Max (m3/s)` = rear_mad_max, # `Rearing Wetland Multiplier` = rear_wetland_multiplier, # `Rearing Lake Multiplier` = rear_lake_multiplier) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;row_names&quot;) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) %&gt;% rename(Variable = Species) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.1: Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.

To determine which of those crossings had not yet been assessed with Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments we cross-referenced these reports with the PSCIS database, available background info and viewed sites within the output of bcfishpass. Outputs for modelled and PSCIS crossings (barriers and potential barriers) that met the following criteria underwent a detailed review to facilitate prioritization for Phase1 - Fish Passage Assessments and Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmations. Confirmed fish presence upstream of the structure. Stream width documented as &gt; 2.0m in PSCIS. Linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat &lt;8% gradient for 1km. Crossings located on streams classified as 3rd order or higher. Crossings located on streams with &gt;5 ha of modeled wetland and/or lake habitat upstream. Habitat value rated as medium or high in PSCIS. 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures (MoE 2011a). Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered other (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed full assessment was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.4). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. tab_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.4: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011a). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.5, Table 3.6. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(tab_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% mutate(V4 = names(tab_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% select(V4, everything()) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(1) %&gt;% ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.5: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (steelhead) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.5), a total value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020c) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, steelhead rearing maximum gradient threshold (7.4%) was used. To generate areas of habitat upstream, the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011a) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. For this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts. It should be noted however, that box culverts could be considered a viable and economical option as they have been observed as successfully facilitating fish passage on the west coast of the province (Betty Rebellato, Canadian Wildlife Federation - Project Biologist). Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $12500/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 10m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $25k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams (&gt;6m), span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 12m wide span was prescribed). For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.7) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. # print_tab_cost_mult(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;) tab_cost_rd_mult_report %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.7: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.4). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collated on Site Cards. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit CB20-611971. 3.4 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2022) with primarily R (R Core Team 2022) and SQL scripts. The R package fpr contains many specialized custom functions related to the work (Irvine [2022] 2022). In addition to numerous spatial layers sourced through the BC Data Catalogue then stored and queried in a local postgresql and sqlite databases data inputs for this project include: Populated Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 Populated pscis_assessment_template_v24.xls bcfishpass outputs.

Photos and photo metadata 3.5 Mapping Mapping was completed by Hillcrest Geographics. pdf maps were generated using QGIS with data supplied via a postgreSQL database. A QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required for general fish passage mapping was developed and at the time of reporting was kept under version control within bcfishpass.

A total of 191 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 77 crossings considered passable, 10 crossings considered potential barriers and 84 crossings considered barriers according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011a). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 20 crossings assessed were fords and ranked as unknown according to the provincial protocol. Georeferenced field maps are presented here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost benefit analysis and priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites presented in Table 4.1. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. Barrier and Potential Barrier rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011a) and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and OHanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and OHanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` # if(gitbook_on){ # tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments.&#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) # } else tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(scroll = F, caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments.&#39;) tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments.

located near Topley, BC on the mainstem of the Bulkley River. Information on the crossing was scarce so an assessment was prioritized by Canadian Wildlife Federation. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician. The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek (Figures 4.2 - 4.3).. Water temperature was 3.0\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.75 and conductivity was 159uS/cm. Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm. The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm. Dyson (1949) and Stokes (1956) report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports. Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend. A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows. Stokes (1956) reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Bulkley River from the outlet of Bulkley Lake. my_photo1 = fpr::fpr_photo_pull_by_str(site = &#39;bulkley_falls&#39;, str_to_pull = &#39;_u1_&#39;) my_caption1 = paste0(&#39;Bulkley Falls main channel.&#39;) # fpr::fpr_photo_flip(site_id = 1802488, str_to_pull = &#39;6257&#39;) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo1) Figure 4.2: Bulkley Falls main channel. # grid::grid.raster(jpeg::readJPEG(my_photo1)) my_photo2 = fpr::fpr_photo_pull_by_str(site = &#39;bulkley_falls&#39;, str_to_pull = &#39;_u2_&#39;) my_caption2 = paste0(&#39;Bulkley Falls side channel.&#39;) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo2) Figure 4.3: Bulkley Falls side channel. my_caption &lt;- paste0(&#39;Left: &#39;, my_caption1, &#39; Right: &#39;, my_caption2) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo1) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo2) 4.3 Phase 2 During 2021 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 29 sites in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups. A total of approximately 16km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing was conducted at five sites, and five sites were mapped using remotely piloted aircraft. Georeferenced field maps are presented in here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. In total, Twelve crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 10 crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and 5 crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.2 - 4.6 with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as Attachment 3. A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating the quantity of chinook, coho and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure 4.4. Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document. #`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)} else knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)` # if(gitbook_on){ # tab_overview %&gt;% # select(-Tenure) %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Overview of habitat confirmation sites.&#39;) # } else tab_overview %&gt;% # select(-Tenure) %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Overview of habitat confirmation sites.&#39;, scroll = F) tab_overview %&gt;% select(-Tenure) %&gt;% table_phase2_overview(caption_text = &#39;Overview of habitat confirmation sites.

Irvine 2021) with a clear-span bridge and for removal of the collapsed bridge (PSCIS crossing 197912) on Robert Hatch Creek. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was in the process of procuring designs for remediation of fish passage at three sites documented in A. Irvine (2021) including PSCIS 123445 on Tyhee Creek, PSCIS 124500 on Helps Creek and PSCIS 197640 on a tributary to Buck Creek. Additionally, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure were procuring a design for PSCIS crossing 124420 on Mission Creek (a.k.a Station Creek) in Hazleton (pers. comm. Sean Wong, Environmental Programs, MoTi). Details for the habitat confirmation of Mission Creek are included in the associated appendix of this report. 4.5 Phase 4 Ministry of Forest engineers collaborated with Canfor and Coastal Gaslink to replace crossing 197962 on Peacock Creek located on the Morice FSR within the Morice River watershed group. As detailed in the associated attachment within this report, baseline effectiveness monitoring including multipass electrofishing at three closed sites both upstream and downstream of the FSR in the fall of 2021 before the bridge install occurred. "],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations Recommendations for potential incorporation into collaborative watershed connectivity planning for the Elk River watershed group include: Continue to acquire background information and leverage ongoing research initiatives in the region to collaboratively clarify current conditions and identify limiting factors to inform prioritization and effectiveness monitoring programs. Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Look for opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together for maximum likley restoration benefits. Refine barrier thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history types of species of interest. This will further focus efforts of potential remediation actions based on biological attributes (ex. timing of migration, size/direction of fish migrating, population dynamics, etc.) and could result in the consideration of interim stop-gap physical works to alter crossing characteristics that can address key connectivity issues yet be significantly less costly than structure replacements (ex. building up of downstream area with rock riffles to decrease the outlet drop size and/or increasing water depth within pipe with baffles and substrate additions). Model fish densities (fish/m2) vs. habitat/water quality characteristics (i.e. gradient, discharge, alkalinity, elevation, riparian health, distance from high order streams, etc.) using historically gathered electrofishing and remotely sensed geodata to inform crossing prioritization, future data acquisition needs and the monitoring of restoration actions. Continue to develop bcfishpass,bcfishobs, fwapg, bcdata and fpr as well as to share open source data analysis and presentation tools that are scaleable and facilitate continual improvement. Tools should continue to be flexible and well documented to allow the future incorporation of alternative fragmentation indicators, habitat gain/value metrics and watershed sensitivity indicators. Continue to collaborate with potential partners to build relationships, explore perspectives and develop road maps for aquatic restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.)  documenting the people involved, discussions and processes that are undertaken, funding options, synergies, measures of success, etc. "],["appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html", "Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos", " Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos Location and Stream Data Crossing Characteristics  Date 2021-08-30 Crossing Sub Type Bridge PSCIS ID 197900 Diameter (m) 13.5 External ID 1805532 Length (m) 6 Crew AI Embedded  UTM Zone 9 Depth Embedded (m)  Easting 685314.1 Resemble Channel  Northing 6030317 Backwatered  Stream Crow Creek Percent Backwatered  Road CN Railway Fill Depth (m)  Road Tenure Canadian National Outlet Drop (m)  Channel Width (m)  Outlet Pool Depth (m)  Stream Slope (%)  Inlet Drop  Beaver Activity  Slope (%)  Habitat Value  Valley Fill  Final score 0 Barrier Result Passable Fix type  Fix Span / Diameter  Photos: PSCIS ID 197900.

PSCIS crossing 57944 is located on Highway 16. Crossing 57944 was located 0.2km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 57944 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 57944, Toboggan Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 119.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2586m to 412m near the crossing (Table 5.1). Upstream of crossing 57944, longnose sucker, cutthroat trout, pink salmon, coho salmon, rainbow trout, steelhead, kokanee, sockeye salmon, chinook salmon, mountain whitefish, dolly varden, sculpin (general), and lamprey (general) have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). There is a wealth of information available for Toboggan Creek with numerous references available through the Skeena Salmon Data Centre. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.1: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 57944.

The hatchery has been operated by the Toboggan Creek Salmon &amp; Steelhead Enhancement Society since 1985. The hatchery serves to enhance coho and chinook stocks in the watershed as well as help assess coho stock with coded wire tag hatchery releases (Smithers District Chamber of Commerce 2022; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Office of Wetsuweten (2016) report that Toboggan hatchery fish have been used to enhance the Bulkley mainstem, Maxan Creek and Buck Creek with chinook fry and smolt. Office of Wetsuweten (2016) note that Wetsuweten Knowledge documents Toboggan Lake as a sockey nursery lake. Additionally, as cited in Office of Wetsuweten (2016), K. Rabnett, Holland, and Gottesfeld (2017) report a historic fishery at the outlet of Toboggan Lake where an extirpated stock of sockeye stock existed. Toboggan Lake is 25ha in size and modelling indicates an additional 256ha of wetland upstream of the highway. Significantly sized lakes within watersheds can throttle high freshet and storm flows often resulting in increased stability downstream and conditions conducive to egg incubation and juvenile rearing. Works to remediate fish passage issues at PSCIS stream crossing 57944 were conducted in 2015 with backwatering completed through installation of boulders downstream of the crossing (McCarthy and Fernando 2015). Comparison of historic PSCIS photos and data between 2021 and 2012 indicate that the historical recorded outlet drop of 90cm has been reduced to 0cm as a result of the works. Sandra Devcic, DFO Restoration Engineer (pers. comm.) has noted that developing a design to replace the crossing with an open bottom structure presents challenges due to the stream crossing location at the bottom of a hill and on a corner of the highway. In 2021 at the time of the assessment, pink salmon spawners were noted as present at the enumeration fences near the hatchery indicating that the highway structure was passable to these relatively weak swimmers in 2021. PSCIS stream crossing 57944 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Irvine (2018), A. Irvine (2021) and Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.2.

The average channel width was 13.9m, the average wetted width was 6.7m and the average gradient was 5.5%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. Although rated as an important migration corridor, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 57944 for 880m (Figures 5.3 - 5.4). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders., Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders. The average channel width was 8.5m, the average wetted width was 6.7m and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The first 50 - 100m upstream of crossing channel and banks were noted as armoured with riprap. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids were noted throughout. The habitat was rated as high value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. The stream was also surveyed at a second location upstream of the hatchery adjacent to the Owen Road bridge for 150m (Figures 5.5 - 5.6). Total cover amount was rated as abundant with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. The average channel width was 12.6m, the average wetted width was 10.5m and the average gradient was 0.5%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. The habitat was rated as high value for salmon rearing and spawning. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 57944 with a bridge (13.5m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $8,100,000 for a cost benefit of 6.5 linear m/$1000 and 54.9 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 52.4km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 57944 rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 57944 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Toboggan Creek represents an extremely important system for the Bulkley River system in terms of fisheries values, its function for outreach within the community as well as its contribution to stock enhancement and assessment. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge may be considered as a prudent step to mitigating risks of a blow out of the backwatering works currently in place downstream and a return to conditions similiar to those observed historically when a significant outlet drop was present (Figures 5.7 - 5.8). tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.4: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 57944.

The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. The habitat was rated as high value for salmon rearing and spawning. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.9 - 5.10 and Figure 5.9. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 123770 with a bridge (19m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $11,400,000 for a cost benefit of 1 linear m/$1000 and 12.5 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 11.7km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 123770 rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 123770 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. John Brown Creek is a large system with habitat suitable for numerous species includeing coho, steelhead and chinook salmon. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge may be considered as a prudent step to eliminating an outlet drop, reducing flow velocities at the highway crossing and mitigating risks of a blow out to the baffle induced partial embedding currently in place in the south pipe of the crossing. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.8: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 123770.

PSCIS crossing 124420 is located on Highway 16. Crossing 124420 was located 1.8km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 124420 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 124420, Mission Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 28.6km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2171m to 211m near the crossing (Table 5.11). Upstream of crossing 124420, cutthroat trout, pink salmon, coho salmon, rainbow trout, bull trout, and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) report that the crossing structure located on Highway 16 and Station Creek has been the subject of numerous assessments and designs with respect to the rehabilitation of fish passage, and they rated this crossing as the highest priority for rehabilitation in the Bulkley River watershed. Gitxsan Watershed Authority reports that Xsan Xsagiibil was a fishing site located at the mouth of Station Creek (Xsi Gwin Sagiiblax) (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Identified as a high priority for additional assessments by K. Rabnett and Williams (2004), SKR Consultants Ltd. (2006) conducted a detailed inspection, offered rehabilitation design options and identified the natural limits of potential fish distribution to support rehabilitation efforts. At the time of reporting, a design for remediation utilizing a retrofit of the existing structure to backwater the pipe was being drafted (Sean Wong, Environmental Programs Manager - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure pers. comm.). A trap and truck operation led by the Chicago Creek Restoration Society moves spawning coho upstream of the crossing annually. Following stream morphology changes which occurred during a fall 2017 flood event causing the release and distribution of sediment loads, Newman and England (2018) conducted a fish habitat assessment from the confluence of Mission Creek with the Bulkley River upstream to the Mile 48 Canadian National railway crossing to determine stream diversity, spawning gravel catchment areas, beaver dam activity and negative impacts present in or along the stream. Beaver control activities on Mission and Waterfall Creeks by CN Rail upstream of crossing 124420 may have been the cause of the 2017 flood event (pers comm.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 124420 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.13). Water temperature was 8\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.9 and conductivity was 89uS/cm.

Total cover amount was rated as with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.16). The average channel width was 6.1m, the average wetted width was 4.6m and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles subdominant. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from 124420 for approximately 370m (Figures 5.20 - 5.21). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.16). The average channel width was 5.7m, the average wetted width was 4.7m and the average gradient was 2%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. Habitat value was rated as high value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 124420 with a bridge (30m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $18,000,000 for a cost benefit of 0.5 linear m/$1000 and 2.9 m2/$1000. These cost benefit estimates assume that adult coho spawner passage through 124420 will result in passage through upstream crossings which rank as barriers according to the provincial metric but are likely to be passable to adult coho. # The cost of the work is estimated at \\$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = &#39;,&#39;)` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\\$1000. Conclusion There was 124420 is 9.3km of habitat upstream of crossing rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 124420 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was in the process of developing a design to retrofit the existing structure at 124420 with some sort of backwatering mechanism so that it could pass adult coho spawners. Although, backwatering can be considered an interim solution, replacement of this crossing with an open bottom structure is recomended in the long term. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2 | Site == my_site3 ) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;, &#39;, my_site2, &#39; and &#39;, my_site3, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.16: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 124420, 124421 and 124422.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 197912 was comprised of a collapsing bridge (Table 5.24). The structure may have been presenting an impediment to upstream fish passage for adult fish and the bridge debris in the channel was resulting in erosion of the banks adjacent to the historic structure. Water temperature was 12\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8 and conductivity was 283uS/cm. Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft immediately upstream and downstream of the crossing with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model presented in Figures 5.31 - 5.32. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.24: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 197912.

Total cover amount was rated as with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.25). The average channel width was 4.7m, the average wetted width was 3.2m and the average gradient was 1.2%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197912 The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from 197912 for approximately 340m to the location of a large beaver dam (Figures 5.36 - 5.37). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation (Table 5.25). The average channel width was 4.3m, the average wetted width was 2.5m and the average gradient was 1.5%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. Habitat value was rated as high value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.26 - 5.27 and Figure 5.33. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, removal of PSCIS crossing 197912 is recommended. In addition to removal of the collapsed bridge, resloping of banks and the installation of live cuttings/pegboarding is recommended in three areas downstream where cattle trampling is resulting in significant erosion. A map of the erosion areas and associated prescriptions for rehabilitation of the downstream corners is provided as Figure ??. The cost of the work is estimated at $30,000 for a cost benefit of 924 linear m/$1000 and 3973.2 m2/$1000. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/robert_hatch_plan_20211023_k_.JPG&quot;) Conclusion There was 197912 is 27.7km of habitat upstream of crossing rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning.

PSCIS crossing 197960 is located on CN Railway. Crossing 197960 was located 2.7km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 197960 is the responsibility of the Canadian National Railway. Background At crossing 197960, Corya Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 65.7km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2502m to 410m near the crossing (Table 5.28). Upstream of crossing 197960, rainbow trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). PSCIS crossing 124612 is a bridge located 800m upstream at the powerline crossing and PSCIS crossing 123776 is a newly installed bridge downstream on Highway 16. Witset Creek drains Witset Lake and is a tributary to Corya Creek that flows in immediately downstream of the Highway 16 bridge. Witset Lake is 41ha in size with an associated 12ha of wetland. The upper Corya Creek watershed is glaciated and may provide habitat conditions most suitable for bull trout and cutthroat due to cold water and turbid conditions due to glacial flour. Although only rainbow trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded upstream of the railway, the historic culvert under Highway 16 and the current culvert under the railway may have hindered passage by other species including anadromous salmon. In spring of 2017 a flood event caused by beaver dam failure forced the evacuation of homes in the Two Mile subdivision of Moricetown (Smithers Interior News 2017). Since this time beaver control activities have taken place in both the Corya and Witset watersheds to reduce the risk of flooding (pers comm.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and deep pools. The average channel width was 25.4m, the average wetted width was 8.9m and the average gradient was 1.7%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The stream was moderately turbid due to glacial flour with abundant quantities of gravels suitably sized for trout and salmon species present. The stream channel was noted as riffle dominated with a lack of complexity due to adjacent riparian clearing and dyke installation. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197960 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197960 for 1000m (Figures 5.41 - 5.42). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, and undercut banks. The average channel width was 18m, the average wetted width was 8.9m and the average gradient was 2.8%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The first 50 - 100m upstream of crossing channel and banks were noted as armoured with riprap. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids were noted throughout. The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.33 - 5.34 and Figure 5.38. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197960 with a bridge (23m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $13,800,000 for a cost benefit of 0.7 linear m/$1000 and 13 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 10km of habitat upstream of crossing 197960 rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197960 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. The stream is a cold water glaciated system and may currently provide habitat conditions most suitable for dolly varden and cutthrout trout. Crossing 197960 was ranked as a low priority for remediation at the time of reporting due to low habitat value within the channel connecting Witset Lake to Corya Creek. Beaver control activities within the watershed to reduce the risk of flooding in the Moricetown likely impacts flow patterns (shorter freshet and flashier flows following precipitation) and the subsequent habitat quality in Witset Creek. A watershed level plan to hold more water on the landscape upstream of the highway and increase the capacity of PSCIS crossing 197960 to pass higher flow events could be considered in the long term to increase the overall health of the watershed and improve the potential for connectivity between Corya Creek and Witset Lake. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39; and &#39;, my_site2, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.32: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197960 and 123775.

PSCIS crossing 197967 is located on Highway 16, approximately 2.5km upstream from Bulkley Lake. Although Taman Creek flows into this stream approximately 750m upstream of the highway, the stream at the highway is commonly referred to as Taman Creek including on highway signage. The culvert is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 197967, the Upper Bulkey River is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 93.8km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1373m to 375m near the crossing (Table 5.35). Upstream of crossing 197967, longnose sucker, largescale sucker, lake chub, brassy minnow, northern pikeminnow, longnose dace, redside shiner, and rainbow trout have previously been recorded upstream (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.35: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 197967.

They also report excellent and good rearing potential in upper reaches of the stream located from 5.1km to 7.8km upstream of the confluence. McCarthy and Fernando (2015) report that the culvert has received past efforts to facilitate backwatering including rock lines to establish backwater pools downstream of the culvert. They also report that the works were not functioning correctly. Smith (2018) visited the site in 2017, subjectively rated the crossing as a potential barrier and ranked the crossing as a low priority for follow up. A. Irvine (2021) noted that a design was being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing by Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure in 2021. PSCIS stream crossing 197967 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing and because gathering of habitat confirmation information was considered as potentially beneficial for informing prioritization of the site should remediation plans stall. A total of 172ha of lake and 695ha of wetland is modelled upstream and a summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.36.

The dominant substrate was cobbles with fines sub-dominant., The average channel width was 5.7m, the average wetted width was 3.1m, and the average gradient was 2.5%., Total cover amount was rated as trace with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as deep pools and instream vegetation. The site was noted as having significant amounts of thick red colored algae for the majority of survey. Flow was very low with uncommon pools. Fence material was noted in or across channel in two locations and and riparian vegetation had been removed where an agricultural field and fence line were close. Although considered an important migration corridor, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning due to limited complexity resulting from adjacent agricultural activities. PSCIS crossing 197964 is located on the CN Railway approximately 1.7km downstream of the highway. Although the crossing was assessed as a potential barrier according to the provincial protocol it was 100% backwatered at the time of the assessment and appeared passable to all species and life stages at the time of assessment (Table 5.38). fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo(dat = pscis_phase1, site = 1805529, site_photo_id = 1805529, col_filter = my_crossing_reference) Table 5.38: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 1805529.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris and overhanging vegetation., The average channel width was 5.3m, the average wetted width was 2.3m, and the average gradient was 2.5%., The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. The first ~250m of channel upstream of the highway were noted as beaver influenced wetland with extensive dry sections at the time of the survey. Frequent pockets of gravels and small cobbles suitable for rainbow trout and coho salmon spawning were noted throughout the area surveyed. A canyon section of stream was located upstream of the crossing approximately 300m contained deep bedrock pools with small fish present and no large woody debris. One deep pool upstream of the canyon section contained likely 2-3 year old juveniles (coloring indicated rainbow trout, unverified). The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Taman Creek was surveyed for 375m above where it joins the Bulkley River mainstem upstream of PSCIS crossing 197967 (Figures 5.47 - 5.48). The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant., Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation., The average channel width was 3.8m, the average wetted width was 2.2m, and the average gradient was 2.5%. The water in Taman Creek during the survey was noted as turbid with numerous samlonid fry present at the downstream end of the site. Algae was abundant throughout the system and eroding banks were common. Abundant gravels suitable for resident rainbow trout and coho salmon spawning were present and habitat was rated as NA value for salmon rearing and spawning. The upper Bulkley River was surveyed at numerous crossings upstream of the highway with bridges noted at PSCIS crossings 197968, 197969, 197973 and 197971. Survey crews were not able to access crossing 1802047 from Highway 16 due to a gate and private land postings. This crossing is located between Broman Lake and Old Woman Lake with public access potentially possible by ATV from the powerline to the north. Modelled crossing 1802663 is located on the mainstem of Taman Creek 1.8km upstream of the confluence with the upper Bulkley River. Although this site was not assessed it was considered likely to be a ford due to its location on the powerline. Numerous other unassessed crossings are modelled as located upstream within the system on Taman Creek as well as the upper Bulkley River and their tributaries. As the effort required to assess all these crossings was likely significant with the majority of higher value gains most likely present in the lower reaches, field time was allocated elsewhere in the greater Bulkley River watershed. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197967 with a bridge (31m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $18,600,000 for a cost benefit of 2.8 linear m/$1000 and 14.8 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 51.9km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197967 rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197967 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of transportation and Infrastructure were in the process of planning for crossing replacement. Of note, due to budgetary constraints, survey plans for the site call for horizontal drilling of a closed bottom structure under the highway with costs likley lower than those estimated for replacement with a clear span bridge. Should structure replacement proceed follow up monitoring is recomended to assess passability and utilization of the crossing by downstream fish populations including coho who have been recorded in the upper Bulkley River within 100m downstream of crossing 197967. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.39: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197967.

PSCIS crossing 197976 is located on Highway 16 and 197975 is located on a private driveway. Crossing 197976 was located 4.2km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and crossing 197975 was located 393m upstream fo Highway 16. Crossing 197976 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and crossing 197976 is the responsibility of the private land owner. Background At crossing 197976, Ailport Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 66.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1445m to 375m near the crossing (Table 5.40). Upstream of crossing 197976, cutthroat trout, coho salmon, and rainbow trout have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report that upper Bulkley coho and steelhead spawn and rear in Ailport Creek. An adjacent landowner noted that in the past, during a high flow event, an adult steelhead was stranded in a pond at the side of the field adjacent to the stream upstream of crossing 197975. Another adjacent landowner reports that historic high flow events in the watershed were likely related to beaver dam failures in the upper reaches of the stream network. DFO (1998), (as cited in McCarthy and Fernando (2015)) reported that crossing 197976 was a barrier at low flows. Following site visits in 2007 and 2017, Wilson and Rabnett (2007) and Smith (2018) reported that the culvert was not an issue for passage. There were no records found of crossing 197975 being assessed for fish passage in the past. Government of British Columbia (2022) records indicate that downstream of 197976 a range tenure is held by 102039220 Saskatchewan Ltd. and that tenure for the first 210m of stream immediately upstream of the highway is registered to Danny Staudt. Additionally, there are multiple other range tenures overlapping Ailport Creek and tributaries further up in the watershed. There are numerous modelled stream crossing locations upstream of 197975 however all crossings on the mainstem appear to be bridges in aerial imagery. PSCIS stream crossings on Ailport Creek were ranked as high priorities for follow up by A. Irvine (2021) and Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing. A total of 42ha of lake and 374ha of wetland is modelled upstream with a summary of additional habitat modelling outputs presented in Tables 5.41 - 5.42.

The average channel width was 7.7m, the average wetted width was 3.4m, and the average gradient was 1%., The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant., Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation. Although side channels continued to flow throughout the area surveyed, approximately 160m downstream of the crossing the main channel was dewatered below the location of a beaver dam. Areas of riparian and bank degradation from cattle trampling were noted throughout the area surveyed and there was fencing spanning the channel. Large deposits of substrate and clumped large woody debris piles were observed within widened channel areas indicating disturbance and high flow events. There were abundant gravels presetn suitable for spawning resident and anadromous salmonids. Habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning with numerous fish observed and numerous deep pools to 0.95m deep. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197976 and downstream of 197975 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197976 for 345m (Figures 5.52 - 5.53). The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant., Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation., The average channel width was 8.1m, the average wetted width was 4.2m, and the average gradient was 1%. Fish were observed throughout the area surveyed and extensive algae growth was present on stream substrates. Large woody debris was rare and riparian/bank damage due to livestock was minimal and located at what appeared to be watering sites. Fencing was located across the stream in multiple locations. Patches of gravels suitable for spawning were present. Habitat value was rated as medium as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. 5.4 Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197975 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197975 for 550m (Figures 5.54 - 5.55). The average channel width was 7.7m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 1%., Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation., The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant. Immediately upstream of the crossing for ~80m, extensive anthropogenic damage was noted due to dredging of the channel. Heavy cattle grazing was also observed on the left bank. Juvenile salmonids were observed occasionally throughout the area surveyed. Fencing was located across the stream approximately 250m upstream of the culvert. Patches of gravels suitable for spawning were present. Habitat value was rated as medium as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.46 - 5.47 and Figure 5.49. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197976 with a bridge (12.5m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $7,500,000 for a cost benefit of 3.3 linear m/$1000 and 27.1 m2/$1000. As the crossing partially backwaters naturally, a plan to backwater the crossing could also be of consideration in the short term with a rough cost estimate to complete of $25,000. Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197975 with a bridge (11.5m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $230,000 for a cost benefit of 107.3 linear m/$1000 and 826.6 m2/$1000. Relocation of the driveway accessing the private land from the other side of the stream and removal of the crossing could also be considered. Conclusion There was 24.7km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197975 rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197976 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement as it appears to pass fish during most flows. Crossing 197975 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement as it appears to likely present a more serious impediment to upstream passage and because implementation of the works can be considered cost effective and logistically less complicated than works on a major highway. As Ailport Creek appears to be a high value fish stream with significant impacts due to culvert maintenance (dredging), adjacent land use (cattle trampled banks and grazed/removed riparian vegetation) and high flow events (potentially beaver dam failure related), it is recommended that a plan be developed to work with adjacent landowners and tenure holders to exclude cattle from the riparian area, implement stream restoration actions and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.45: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197976.

PSCIS crossing 198066 is located on a small private road and 123377 is located on Walcott Road. Crossing 198066 was located 0.1km upstream from the confluence with a side channel of the Bulkley River and 123377 was located 2.4km upstream of the confluence. Crossing 198066 was on private land owned by Jeremy Rouw and hay fields as well as other infrastructure that was part of Udder View Dairy were located upstream of the crossing. Crossing 123377 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 198066, Thompson Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 43.1km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1623m to 596m near the crossing (Table 5.58). Upstream of crossing 198066, cutthroat trout, cutthroat/rainbow cross, coastal cutthroat trout, coho salmon, rainbow trout, and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). Landowners adjacent to the stream at both crossings as well as regional DFO staff report that Thompson Creek was historically redirected from its original channel on the height of land near the Bulkley River in the 1960s. The historic channel is visible in aerial imagery and would have directed flows in a north-eastern direction from where the agricultural fields meet the Thompson creek valley. The redirection diverts the channel into two seperate channels that flow south-east. The main flow of the channel was flowing in an excavated trench through the hay field at the time of the survey. The distance from the current confluence with the Bulkley River side channel to the historic valley is approximately 370m. The distance the stream would have traveled historically in a north-eastern direction is estimated at 1300m. The landowner reported that conceptually they would like to see the stream redirected to its historic channel. They noted that stranding has been observed within the excavated channel and a realignment would help prevent the loss of hay production caused by the high water table adjacent to the excavated channel. A map of the current man made channels and the historic channel is provided in Figure ??. Adjacent landowners also report that the crossing at Walcott Road had nearly washed out at the road due to high flows related to beaver dam failures. Crossing 123378 is a bridge on Thompson Creek on the BC Hydro powerline between 198066 and 123377. Landowners report this bridge washed out at the time of the beaver dam failure and was replaced in 2020. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.58: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 198066.

The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 198066 and downstream of 123377 The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from 198066 for approximately NAm (Figures 5.69 - 5.70). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as deep pools and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.62). The average channel width was 2.8m, the average wetted width was 2.1m and the average gradient was 0.5%. The dominant substrate was NA with NA subdominant. Habitat value was rated as medium value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, replacement of PSCIS crossing 198066 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. # The cost of the work is estimated at \\$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = &#39;,&#39;)` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\\$1000.
