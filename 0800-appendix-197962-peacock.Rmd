## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 9km west of Houston, BC. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Morice River.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests.


<br>

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m  near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197962)). 

<br>

Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, no fish species have previously been recorded within provincial databases [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. 

<br>

@mccarthy_fernando20152015Inventory and @smith2018AssessingBarriers reported that a large concrete weir and spillway that were built in the 1990s were not functioning correctly and that the crossing was a high priority fish barrier.  @gaboury_smith2016DevelopmentAquatic conducted a site survey in 2015 and produced design options to remediate passage.  There were no records of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` within PSCIS before the 2021 assessment data was loaded in.  The site was prioritized for follow up because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197962)). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-backwatered, un-embedded and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197962)). Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

##this is useful to get some comments for the report

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197962-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197962-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197962-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`
Multiple areas of side channels and small braided sections were noted with intermittent sections of aggraded cobbles / gravels moved in high flows. There were pockets of gravel present suitable for spawning resident and anadromous salmonids.  
The complex habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 


## Stream Characteristics Upstream  {-}


`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197962-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197962-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197962-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph()` 
Survey notes indicate signs of high powerful flows, including clumped large woody debris. Patches of gravels suitable for spawning were present. Habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having high rearing potential.


## Fish Sampling {-}

Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-197962) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197962) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-197962).  

## Structure Remediation and Cost {-}

Through a collaboration between FLNR, Canfor and Coastal Gaslink, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was remediated in the fall of 2021 shortly after habitat confirmation field assessments were completed.  


<br>



## Conclusion {-}

Access was restored to an estimated `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` due to the replacement of the culvert with a clear span bridge. Although numerous dolly varden and several rainbow trout were captured upstream, coho salmon were captured downstream only before the site restoration indicating that `r as.character(my_site)` was a complete barrier to upstream fish passage.  The completion of three multi-pass closed electrofishing sites both upstream and downstream of the crossing can provide baseline data for future effectiveness monitoring at the site to track changes in fish population structure resulting from the works.
