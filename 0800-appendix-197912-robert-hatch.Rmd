## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` near Topley, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a small private road and the Hatch Creek Ranch.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with Richfield Creek. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is the responsibility of the range tenure holder (Hatch Creek Ranch Ltd. - forest file id RAN074136 and Groot Bros. Contracting Ltd. - forest file id RANM01180) where the road is located.

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197912)). No fish have previously been recorded at the site [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Canadian Wildlife Federation because of the relatively large size of the stream and habitat rated as high value in PSCIS (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197912).  A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was comprised of a collapsing bridge (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197912)). The structure may have been presenting an impediment to upstream fish passage for adult fish and the bridge debris in the channel was resulting in erosion of the banks adjacent to the historic structure.  Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm. Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft immediately upstream and downstream of the crossing with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(" presented in Figures \\@ref(fig:ortho-caption-robert-hatch) - \\@ref(fig:model-caption-robert-hatch).")} else knitr::asis_output("presented [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public/aebd400d8dbe455eb3806b1ca8a4c496) and [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public_3D/aebd400d8dbe455eb3806b1ca8a4c496).")`

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197912-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197912-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197912-d01))"))`. Total cover amount was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'ds', cover_type = 'total cover')` with  `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'ds', cover_type = 'dominant')` dominant. Cover was also present as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'ds', cover_type = 'sub-dominant')` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197912)). The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant.  The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {-}


The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m to the location of a large beaver dam `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197912-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197912-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197912-d02))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'us', cover_type = 'total_cover')` with  `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'us', cover_type = 'dominant')` dominant. Cover was also present as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'us',cover_type = 'sub-dominant')` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197912)). The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant. Habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info()` value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. 

## Fish Sampling {-}

Electrofishing was conducted downstream of the collapsed bridge with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-197912) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197912) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-197912).


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, removal of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is recommended. In addition to removal of the collapsed bridge, resloping of banks and the installation of live cuttings/pegboarding is recommended in three areas downstream where cattle trampling is resulting in significant erosion.  A map of the erosion areas and associated prescriptions for rehabilitation of the downstream corners is provided as Figure \@ref(fig:fig-channel-197912).  The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.

## Conclusion {-}

There was `r as.character(my_site)` is `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing with areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for removal.  As Robert Hatch Creek appears to be a high value fish stream with significant impacts due to adjacent land use (cattle trampled banks and grazed/removed riparian vegetation), it is recommended that a plan be developed to work with adjacent landowners and tenure holders to exclude cattle from the riparian area, implement stream restoration actions and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed.
