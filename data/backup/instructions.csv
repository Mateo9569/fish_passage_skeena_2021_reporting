This spreadsheet is part of the:
Fish Data Submission Process
which is a required process for Scientific Fish Data Collection Permit holders who utilized their permit.
Completion of the Spreadsheet for Scientific Fish Data Collection Permits requires adherence to
Minimum Data Standards
INSTRUCTIONS:
For Scientific Fish Data Collection Permits:
All fields with Red column headings are required as a minimum data standard
"All fields with a Purple column heading are required for specific situations. See ""pop up"" comments for each heading"
All fields with Blue column headings are optional but preferred (recommended) for most activities
"Completion of this spreadsheet is still required if during a visit where the intention is to sample fish: no fish are caught or streams are ""Dewatered-Dry/Intermittent"""
Red Triangles in the upper right corner of the fields indicate that there are comments for you to read when you hover your cursor over the triangle
"Drop down choices are provided for cells where appropriate. They will have headers designating the drop down feature. Each comment pop-up in those fields, will additionally show the drop down options. The options for the selector are in descriptive text. For the convenience of those who have used standard field site cards and fish collection forms that utilize codes; the associated code is also provided in the comment pop-ups."
"For Step 2, Enable the macros in the spreadsheet in order to have functionality of the Date/Time selector."

OTHER INSTRUCTIONS/INFORMATION:
1) If no sampling was conducted a Project Submission Form must still be completed at the:
Online Fish Data Submissions SharePoint Site
2) We will accept Field Data Information System (FDIS) capture tool data as a substitute for this spreadsheet
"3) In addition to this spreadsheet or an FDIS file, we encourage the submission of written reports and digital maps (*.PDF), additional data files, photographs, and map plot files."
4) Question or comments can be sent via email to:
fishdatasub@gov.bc.ca
5) Data submissions must be sent to:
Online Fish Data Submissions SharePoint
6) The spreadsheet is a standardized data collection tool for the Fish Data Submission Process based on the
FDIS data capture tool
and the
RISC Site Card and Fish Collection Forms
7) Usage of the RISC Site Cards and Fish Collection Forms to collect data at the time of your field survey will be beneficial in providing the correct information and formats to the excel template
