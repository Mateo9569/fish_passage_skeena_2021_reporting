Great creek with variety of habitat consistently encountered on survey. Difficult to choose dominant type as they are evenly spread. A few spots banks were vertical (outside bend) but not enough to be labelled that way on field card. Large and small woody debris less frequent than upstream and once again appears somewhat clumped. Multiple areas of side channels and small braided sections and a few areas of steep piles of cobbles / gravels moved in high flows. Signs of high flows significantly moving substrate and debris but not enough to be a disturbance indicator. Overall moderate to high value habitat. Substrate mainly large cobble and small boulder. Lots of nice straight runs with substrate habitat. Consistent undercut banks with small and large woody debris and overhanigng vegetation providing cover.

Very functional but may be challenging in low water for upstream access. Great stream complex with all types of habitat throughout and consistent. Tough choise fro dominant however, boulders with straight runs of short riffles occur consistently on survey area. There are also consistent undercut banks, large and small woody debris and some nice pools. A few fish encountered on survey. Signs of high powerful flows, including clumped large woody debris, still functional but can be piled up in a few areas. Large channel and several side channels. One side channel area has large woody debris pile at the top end and main flow appears recently diverted into pile and over newer area. Gradient stays consistent with a few riffles / small cascades around 5. Selected decoupled however, some areas had steep sided banks and landscape. Algae present but not often and not in huge quantities."

81,Waterfall Creek,124420_us2,124420,us2,,2021-09-16,12:30,AI,,,,,,Site is just upstream of confluence with Mission. Deep glide habitat with aquatic vascular plant cover throughout. Area is beaver influenced and provides large amounts of juvenile rearing habitat. WP422 channel splits with more flow from south channel. Channel beside railway is full of grass and duckweed ~3.5m wide.
82,Mission Creek,124420_ds,124420,ds,,2021-09-16,11:07,KP DN,,,,,,"Has very deep undercut banks. High to moderate habitat value. Complex system with lots of small and large woody debris, pools, and deep undercuts. Multiple steep banks showing signs of erosion sluffing and fine sediment. Lots of large and small woody debris. Encountered lots of sediments at times. Multiple areas with braided streams around woody debris. Deep, fast flowing areas (not true pools). Confined valley. Water moderate stage and turbid from recent rains. Possible signs of quick increase in water."
83,Unnamed Tributary to Waterfall Creek,124421_us,124421,us,,2021-09-16,13:09,KP,,,,,,"Not sure about crossing number (furthest south crossing). High to moderate habitat. Slow moving almost wetland like stream. Deep glides throughout. Lots of instream vegetation, overhanging vegetation, and undercut banks. Initially deep organic / fines substrate. Near top of survey, gradient increased slightly and substrate goes to small gravel. Moderate to high stagnant water often smelling of sulfur. Tons of vegetation, shrubs and sedge on banks. Water almost at bankful. Appears to have very unstable flows."

86,Waterfall Creek,,,,,2021-09-16,14:03,DN,,,,,,Water enters wetland complex dense in grasses and shrubs. Deep water and dense instream vegetation. Wetland / stream is relatively straight and runs paralell to railway. Thick grasses make it difficult to walk and estimate width. Water is deeper than 1.5m near stream edge. Water holes throughout.
