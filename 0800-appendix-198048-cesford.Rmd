## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` near Topley, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)`.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and `r as.character(my_site2)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site2, col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of the confluence. Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` makes reference to `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site3, col_pull = road_name)`

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198048)). Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

```

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a priority for follow up by @irvine2021BulkleyRiver because of the relatively large size of the stream and the potential for large amounts of habitat gains through fish passage remediation (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198048).  Although @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage recommended establishing a downstream weir and excavating adequate outfall drop pools to facilitate fish passage at crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, they ranked the site as a moderate priority for remediation due to dewatering below Highway 16. @smith2018AssessingBarriers assessed teh site in 2017 and noted that a comparison of photos taken in 2006 and 2017 indicates that a significant amount of gravel has been deposited in the channel below the culvert outlets. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment](Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198048)). Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198048-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198048-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198048-d01))"))`. Total cover amount was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'ds', cover_type = 'total cover')` with  `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'ds', cover_type = 'dominant')` dominant. Cover was also present as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'ds', cover_type = 'sub-dominant')` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-198048)). The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant.  The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`{-}


The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198048-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198048-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198048-d02))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'us', cover_type = 'total_cover')` with  `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'us', cover_type = 'dominant')` dominant. Cover was also present as `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_cover(loc = 'us',cover_type = 'sub-dominant')` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-198048)). The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant. Habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info()` value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. 




## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. 

```{r}
# The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000. 

```

<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There was `r as.character(my_site)` is `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat upstream of crossing rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
