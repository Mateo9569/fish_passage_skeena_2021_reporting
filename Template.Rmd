Modern civilization has a long journey ahead to acknowledge and address the historic and ongoing impacts of colonialism that have resulted in harm to the cutures and livelihoods of those that have lived in harmony with the land on Turtle Island for many thousands of years. That harm extends naturally to the ecosystems themselves.

This report builds on reporting from the spring of 2021 which can be reference [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/).  The work presented currently is in a rough draft form for partner and stakeholder engagement purposes, contains errors and will change extensively over time. 

<br>


The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage]. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. 

<br>

In April of 2020, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) undertook an initiative to plan and conduct fish passage restoration planning activities in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed.  The initiative was supported by a grant from the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund that leveraged funds committed in the fall of 2019 from the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation.  New Graph Environment and Hillcrest Geographics were the project team subcontracted to devise the study plan, submit proposals and complete the work which included information gathering, updating/implementation of open source data analysis tools, fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments.  Although fish passage restoration planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries.


<br>

In August of 2020, following a province wide prioritization exercise and a series of workshops, the Canadian Wildlife Federation selected the Bulkley River watershed group as a target watershed for connectivity planning efforts supported by a grant from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund.  Recognizing synergies between the two initiatives, select project activities of both initiatives became a collaboration between SERNbc and CWF with extensive input from numerous organizations and individuals connected to the watersheds. 


<br>

Spearheaded by the Canadian Wildlife Federation, a Fish Passage Working Group consisting of First Nations, non-profits, stakeholder groups and regulators was established for the Bulkley River watershed group in the fall of 2020. At the time of reporting, collaborative decision making processes regarding connectivity issues were underway through monthly meetings with results forthcoming in a watershed connectivity remediation plan. At the time of reporting, the scope of connectivity planning explored by the Working Group included the Bulkley River watershed group and not yet the Morice River and other sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed.

<br>

Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify.  Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives.  When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

# Background

The study area includes the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups (Figure \@ref(fig:overview-map)) and is  within the  traditional territories of the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en.  

<br>


## Wet'suwet'en

Wet'suwet'en hereditary territory covers an area of 22,000km^2^ including the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds and portions of the Nechako River watershed.  The Wet'suwet'en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction.  Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet'suwet'en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it's management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet'suwet'en [@officeofthewetsuweten2013Wetsuwet; @OfficeoftheWetsuweten2021; @flnrord2017NaturalResource].


<br>

## Gitxsan

The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km^2^ within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds.  The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) [@GitxsanHuwilpGovernment2021].

```

<br>

### Bulkley River

The Bukley River is an 8th  order stream that drains an area of 7,762 km^2^ in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08EE004")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08EE003")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston.  Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology-plot) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats1)). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology-plot) and \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats2)).  

<br>


Changes  to  the  climate  systems  are  causing  impacts  to  natural  and  human systems  on  all  continents  with  alterations  to  hydrological  systems  caused  by  changing  precipitation  or melting  snow  and  ice  increasing  the  frequency  and  magnitude  of  extreme  events  such  as  floods  and droughts [@ipcc2014Climatechange; @eccc2016Climatedata].  These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow  periods  [@ilmb2007MoriceLand]. 

<br>

The valley  bottom has  seen  extensive  settlement  over  the  past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston.  As  a  major  access  corridor  to  northwestern  British  Columbia,  Highway  16  and  the  Canadian  National Railway  are  major  linear  developments  that  run  along  the  Bulkley  River  within  and  adjacent  to  the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats.  Additionally, as the valley bottom  contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion  of  riparian  ecosystems  to  hayfields  and  pastures  leading  to  alterations  in  flow  regimes, increases  in  water  temperatures,  reduced  streambank  stability,  loss  of  overstream  cover  and channelization [@ilmb2007MoriceLand; @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage].

### Morice River

The Morice River watershed drains 4,379 km^2^ of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction.  The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River.  There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only [@environmentandclimatechangecanada2021NationalWater].  An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it's confluence with the Bulkley River is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08ED003")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s.  Mean annual discharge is estimated at `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08ED002")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake.  Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall.  This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology-plot2) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats3)).

## Fisheries

In 2004, @ibmbusinessconsultingservices2006ValuationWild estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars.  The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery [@tamblyn2005PlanConserve].  

### Bulkley River

Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage]. @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage detail numerous fishing  areas located within the lower Bulkley  drainage (from  the confluence of the Skeena to the confluence with the Telkwa River) and the upper Bulkley drainage which includes the mainstem Bulkley River and tributaries upstream of the Telkwa River confluence. Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet'suwet'en  (Wilson and Rabnett 2007; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet'suwet'en).

<br>

 
Approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Bulkley River, producing a steep cascade section.  This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows.  Coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972 [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage].

<br>

Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province.  In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process.   The plan  introduces a number of  regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities.  Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River.  The Bukley River is considered Class II waterand there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence [@flnro2013BulkleyRiver; @flnro2013OverviewAngling; @flnrord2019FreshwaterFishing].

<br>

### Morice River

Detailed reviews of Morice River watershed fisheries can be found in @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice,  @gottesfeld_etal2002ConservingSkeena, @schell2003BriefOverview, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish, and @ilmb2007MoriceLand with a comprehensive review of water quality by @oliver2018Analysiswater.  Overall, the Morice watershed contains high fisheries values as a major producer of chinook, pink, sockeye, coho and steelhead.  

<br>

#### Fish Species

Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups are detailed in Table \@ref(tab:fiss-species-table) [@data_fish_obs].  Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena and Bulkley River fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in  @schell2003BriefOverview,  @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage,   @gottesfeld_etal2002ConservingSkeena and @officeofthewetsuweten2013Wetsuwet.  @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station  Creek,  Harold  Price  Creek,  Telkwa  River  and  Buck  Creek.    Key  areas  within  the  upper  Bulkley River  watershed  with  high  fishery  values,   documented  in  @schell2003BriefOverview,  are  the  upper  Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek,  Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. 

<br>

Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure \@ref(fig:fish-gantt-morice).  The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned.

<br>

In the 1990's the Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.  Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels.  Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most [@bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice]. @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats.

## Fish Passage Restoration Planning and Implementation


As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued.  A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS).  The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in @fishpassagetechnicalworkinggroupFishPassageStrategic2014 :

 * Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity.
 * Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation.
 * Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. 
 * Phase 4: Remediation – Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers.

### Bulkley River

There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system.  A non-exhaustive list of historic fish passage reports for the watershed includes @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage, @mccarthy_fernando20152015Inventory,@smith2018AssessingBarriers @casselman_stanley2010BulkleyFulton and @irvine2018AnalysisPriority.

<br>

Review of the PSCIS database indicated that prior to 2020, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) at crossing structures within the Bulkley River watershed group have been recorded in the PSCIS database [@moe2021PSCISAssessments]. No habitat confirmations are recorded in the PSCIS database [@moe2021PSCISHabitat].  Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek [@moe2021PSCISRemediation].  McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and a design is currently being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek (pers. comm. Kathryn Graham, Regional Manager Environmental Services - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure).

## Morice river


Within the Morice River watershed group prior to 2020, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX fish passage assessments (Phase 1) had been recorded in the PSCIS database [@moe2021PSCISAssessments]. At the time of reporting, no habitat confirmations had been recorded  [@moe2021PSCISHabitat]. Two culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS in the  and include works on a tributary to the Morice River located at km 39.2 of the Morice River FSR and on bridge installation at km 4 of McBride Road on a tributary to McBride Lake [@moe2021PSCISRemediation].
