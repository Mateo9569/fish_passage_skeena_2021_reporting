## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` within the Coryatsaqua 2 (Moricetown) Indian Reserve at Moricetown, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.


<br>

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-57944)). Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. There is a wealth of information available for Toboggan Creek with numerous references available through the [Skeena Salmon Data Centre](https://data.skeenasalmon.info/dataset?q=Toboggan).

<br>


```{r tab-wshd-57944, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```


<br>

The Toboggan Creek Hatchery facility is located on the stream approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = 57918, col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of Highway 16.  The hatchery has been operated by the Toboggan Creek Salmon & Steelhead Enhancement Society since 1985.  The hatchery serves to enhance coho and chinook stocks in the watershed as well as help assess coho stock with coded wire tag hatchery releases [@smithersdistrictchamberofcommerce2022TobogganCreek; @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage].  @officeofwetsuweten2016SubmissionCanadian report that Toboggan hatchery fish have been used to enhance the Bulkley mainstem, Maxan Creek and Buck Creek with chinook fry and smolt.

<br>

@officeofwetsuweten2016SubmissionCanadian  note that Wet'suwet'en Knowledge documents Toboggan Lake as a sockey nursery lake. Additionally,
as cited in @officeofwetsuweten2016SubmissionCanadian, @rabnett_etal2017Dispersedtraditional report a historic fishery at the outlet of Toboggan Lake where an extirpated stock of sockeye stock existed.  

<br>

Toboggan Lake is `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site, col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha in size and modelling indicates an additional `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland upstream of the highway.  Significantly sized lakes within watersheds can throttle high freshet and storm flows often resulting in increased stability downstream and conditions conducive to egg incubation and juvenile rearing. 

<br>

Works to remediate fish passage issues at PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` were conducted in 2015 with backwatering completed through installation of boulders downstream of the crossing [@mccarthy_fernando20152015Inventory].  Comparison of historic PSCIS photos and data between 2021 and 2012 indicate that the historical recorded outlet drop of 90cm has been reduced to 0cm as a result of the works.  Sandra Devcic, DFO Restoration Engineer (pers. comm.) has noted that developing a design to replace the crossing with an open bottom structure presents challenges due to the stream crossing location at the bottom of a hill and on a corner of the highway. 

<br>

In 2021 at the time of the assessment, pink salmon spawners were noted as present at the enumeration fences near the hatchery indicating that the highway structure was passable to these relatively weak swimmers in 2021.

<br>


PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high priority for follow up by @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage, @irvine2018AnalysisPriority, @irvine2021BulkleyRiver and @mazany-wright_etal2021BulkleyRiver because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing.  A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-57944). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-57944)). Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

`r fpr_my_cover_sentence(loc = 'ds')` The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant. Although rated as an important migration corridor, the habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 



## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}


`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_cover_sentence(loc = 'us')` The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant. The first 50 - 100m upstream of crossing channel and banks were noted as armoured with riprap. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids were noted throughout. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential.

<br>

The stream was also surveyed at a second location upstream of the hatchery adjacent to the Owen Road bridge for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-06))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-d03))"))`. `r fpr::fpr_my_cover_sentence(loc = 'us2')` The average channel width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, the average wetted width was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'avg_wetted_width_m')`m and the average gradient was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = "bed_material_dominant")` with `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'us2', col_pull = "bed_material_subdominant")` subdominant.  The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us2')` value for salmon rearing and spawning. 


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.  


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with areas survyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Toboggan Creek represents an extremely important system for the Bulkley River system in terms of fisheries values, it's function for outreach within the community as well as it's contribution to stock enhancement and assessment. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge may be considered as a prudent step to mitigating risks of a blow out of the backwatering works currently in place downstream and a return to conditions similiar to those observed historically when a significant outlet drop was present `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-07) - \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-08))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-57944-d04))"))`.
