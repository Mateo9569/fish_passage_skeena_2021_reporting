## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` adjacent to the west side of Maxan Lake located south of Topley, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with Maxan Lake. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests.


<br>

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197909)). No fish have previously been recorded at the site [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. 


<br>

```{r tab-wshd-197909, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

Although the associated reporting could not be located, fisheries assessments were conducted on the stream approximately 170m downstream of the crossing and 50m upstream of the crossing by FINS Consulting Ltd. in 1999 [@moeStreamInventorySample]. Although information regarding sampling effort is not present, site card notes indicate the site was classified as S6 (non-fish bearing) due to a lack of significant fish habitat.

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up during field assessments because of the presence of modelled habitat upstream and relatively good flows in t he stream when compared to the rest of the culverted streams surveyed in the greater Maxan Creek watershed (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197909).  A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was comprised of an un-embedded and non-backwatered round culvert (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197909)).  Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197909-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197909-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197909-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`
At approximately 300m downstream of the culvert the stream became wider with glide habitat to ~50cm in depth resulting from sediments deposited by a failure on the steep north canyon wall. Habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning due to the small size of the stream, low flows and fine substrate.

<br>


## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` to the location of a series of large beaver dams 
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197909-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197909-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197909-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph()` 
Habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as the area could provide significant amounts of rearing habitat for rainbow and coho if access from downstream was possible.


<br>


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a clear span bridge is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.

## Conclusion {-}

Although past assessment work in the watershed indicates stream is likely non-fish bearing [@moeStreamInventorySample], there was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for rainbow trout and coho rearing. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for removal however this ranking could be revisited in the future should fish presence or potential for fish presence be confirmed through subsequent survey activities.
